# on-the-skin_glucose_sensing_drug_delivery
Project proposal for class ECE481 Nonotechnology at UIUC. Propose to create a device on the skin that sense glucose and deliver drugs

• Product targets diabetic disease patients for better drug delivery and glucose sensing using sweat.
• Device consists of microneedles, glucose sensor, hydrogel, and flexible and stretchable battery.
• Via glucose sensor feedback, a hydrogel with battery charged piezoelectric control insulin diffusion.
